# TaskBoard
Task Board Agent-Based Model

The model aims to illustrate how employees perform a project execution, visualize the task's processing, and depict the Burndown Chart, which integrates the description of the work to do (scope), the deadlines for its execution (schedule), and the calculation of its costs and the resources required for its implementation (cost).

Specifically, we are addressing the following questions: How do the execution delays or advances impact project behavior? How does the task board illustrate the employees? work capacity? Can managers make reasonable decisions regardless of why workers cause delays or produce overruns in their assignments?

To consider our model realistic enough for its purpose, we use the following patterns: The model addresses classic problems of Project Management (PM). It plays the typical task board where workers are assigned to complete a task backlog in project performance. Workers could delay or advance in the task execution, and we calculate Burndown Chart and visualize the project behavior in a task board.
